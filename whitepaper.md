# Whitepaper:

If the supply of a commodity increases with the demand for that same commodity staying the same or dropping,
the price of the commodity drops. Also, as the supply of a commodity decreases with the demand remaing the same or increasing,
the price of the commodity increases. This process of price discovery is what drives asset prices in free markets.
IT is why the halving effect of Bitcoin has seen an increase in the price of Bitcoin. because Bitcoin becomes more scarce as time goes
by, thus ensuring that demand outstrips supply.

Most Masternode projects entice new comers by having a good ROI (read as High ROI) this means that the coin gets dumped
and price suffers. Cycle coin utilizes an equilibruim price seesaw mechanism to vary the coin supply between periods of
high supply and periods of low supply with the coin supply halving after each epoch.

Initially coin supply will be moderate to enable accumulation of coins. This will lead to a low coin supply period and subsequent 
price increase.
